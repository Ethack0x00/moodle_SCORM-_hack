Inspect element over the SCORM frame
Open the console and type:

LMSSetValue('cmi.core.lesson_status', 'completed');

LMSCommit('');

LMSFinish('');

Note that the name of the functions may variate but usually contain the keywords like "SetValue". In my case they are shown as "SCORM_LMSSetValue"


Hope that this works for you.
